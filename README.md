## sample of audioreactive hydra visuals

- they utilize `()=>a.fft[]` to become audio reactive
- I had claude add comments to each one so hopefully it helps to tinker

also check out p5live, just google it and it is a cool browser IDE with some good examples for p5 and hydra

just change the scripted in js file at the bottom of the `index.html` to change animation

script at top of index is used to create random number functions
